# What is it ?

Ava is a general purpose bot/API interacting with NLP/LLM models.  
Ava is named after https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film) and the _J_ ava Virtual Machine.

# What models or APIs does it support ?

Please note OpenAI's GPT-x/Codex models are not the sole actors in LLMs ;)  
However, they received human instruction training (https://openai.com/research/instruction-following) so it's easier to prompt them than other models.  
In other words: *some non-OpenAI models are not fine-tuned for straight question answering*: you need to prompt them using few-shot examples and think of the answer as a natural continuation of your prompt.    
See prompting tips at https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/FAQ.md#2-generations-are-bad

Other models are : BLOOM, SF CodeGen, OPT-175B, BERT, PaLM, AlexaTM, Tabnine, Kite

Currently, supported models are :

- cloud/API based : GPT-3+ (thru OpenAI APIs, an API key is required)
- local usage : BLOOM (thanks to Nouarame Tazi's work https://github.com/NouamaneTazi/bloomz.cpp)

# Overview

It has two components

- a bot: better suited for a chat flow, its default setup is to join your Mattermost server https://mattermost.com/ and wait for a user to chat with.

Q&A: Why Mattermost ? because it is open source and self-hosted. Slack or Discord are not. For veterans, supporting UnrealIRCd is of interest.

*Given the nature of NLP, the less a 3rd party vendor can inspect your usage the better*   
Also OpenAI models are not *public or available locally*, but Huggingface models are, see : https://huggingface.co/bigscience

- a REST API: better suited for completions or general purpose interactions. 

# Considerations and responsible use of AI

Keep in mind *it should not be used for High-Stakes Decision-Making*, see below

# Quickstart

If you want to use local models downloaded from Huggingface : make sure you have enough RAM and disk space !  
For example the pytorch model of `bigscience/bloomz-7b1` weights at 14GB and ggml conversion requires around 10GB of RAM.

1. install a JDK17 from https://sdkman.io/
2. start the on-premise Mattermost chat server `docker compose up`
3. navigate to its http://localhost:8065, create yourself an account for demonstration purposes
4. create a team named `test` and an account `ava@ava.co` for the bot (hint: use "Invite people", copy the "Invite" invitation link in another browser window to create the bot account)  
5. hint: you can configure the bot team and credentials in `application.properties`
6. optional : `env export` a `CLIENT_OPENAI_SECRET_KEY` if you would like to use the OpenAI cloud models. Make sure you understand and cap your billing charges.
7. run Ava : `./gradlew quarkusDev`
8. the bot shall join the default chatroom "Town Square" and greet you: if it does not, check the server logs
9. open a Direct message with the bot, and chat with it.
10. if you want to use an UI the REST API: it is located at http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/


# Sample usage

- bot: TBD
- REST API:
```
curl -v -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"msg":"translate \"Hi, how are you?\" in Spanish:"}' http://localhost:8080/hf/bloom
```
```
sampling parameters: temp = 0.800000, top_k = 40, top_p = 0.950000, repeat_last_n = 64, repeat_penalty = 1.300000  
translate "Hi, how are you?" in Spanish: Me encuentro muy bien. Â¿CÃ³mo estas tÃº? Yo estoy?: me alegro</s> [end of text]
```
