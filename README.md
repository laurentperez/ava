# What is it ?

Ava is a general purpose bot interacting with NLP models or APIs. 

Think BLOOM, GPT-J, GPT-2/3, Codex, CodeGen, OPT-175B, BERT, PaLM, AlexaTM, Tabnine, Kite & all

Ava is named after https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film) and the _J_ ava Virtual Machine.

Keep in mind _it should not be used for High-Stakes Decision-Making_, see below

# Quickstart

1. install JDK17 and gradle from https://sdkman.io/
2. start the on-premise Mattermost chat server `docker-compose up`
3. navigate to its http://localhost:8065 and create a team named "test" and an account for the Ava bot (hint: yo do not need a valid email address, copy the "Invite" link or use the dockerized inbucket email server to get the invitation)
4. you can reconfigure these credentials in `application.properties` or `application.yml`
5. optional : env export your `CLIENT_OPENAI_SECRET_KEY` if you'd like to use the OpenAI/Codex cloud models. Make sure you understand and cap your billing charges.
6. run Ava : `gradle quarkusDev` or `gradle bootRun`
7. the bot shall join the default chatroom "Town Square" and greet you ; if it does not, check the logs

# Usage

# Java frameworks used
